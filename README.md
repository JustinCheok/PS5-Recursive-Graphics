# PS5: Recursive Graphics
What is this assignment:
In this assignment we created a program that plots/ creates a triangle fractal. In order to create
this triangle fractal we needed to use the Sierpinski Triangle. The Sierpinski Triangle is a
self-similar fractal. It contains equilateral triangles, which then has a lot of smaller equilateral
triangles built around it. This method requires to use a recursive function in order to create these
equilateral triangles, that are equivalent in ratio size to the rest of the triangles built around. This
program takes two command-line arguments. The first argument being the length of the side of
the equilateral triangle. And the second argument being the depth of the recursion the program
will run.

## What was accomplished:
What I accomplished in this assignment was I created the triangle fractal. My program takes the
two arguments and then creates the triangles. My program follows the Sierpinski Triangle
method, creating self-similar triangles in a fractal. It also runs in a recursive pattern which
creates each of the triangles to an equilateral size comparison to the rest.

## Key algorithms:
The key algorithm used was the Sierpinski Triangle. In order to create the recursive fractal
triangles it was needed to use this method. Since the triangles we were working with were
equilateral, a recursive function in order to make the fractal was necessary.

## Data Structures:
In this assignment a recursive function was used. It was used in order to make each equilateral
triangle. Depending on the depth entered by the user, that would determine the number of
iterations my recursive function would run. And in the Sierpinski Triangle the iteration is made
through each corner. And each corner needed to have the same amount of times the recursive
function was used. In order to have a neatly displayed triangle, that are all equilaterals and the
same to each respected corner.
